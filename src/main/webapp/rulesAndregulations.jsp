                    we ask for your cooperation. If you violate the rules and regulations and are spotted by a site
                    administrator or are flagged by a fellow user, your work will be subject to review. If it is found that
                    your work is in violation of the rules and regulations, the work will be deleted. If you have repeated
                    violations, your account will be deleted.</p>
                <p>NOTICE: All rules and regulations are subject to change. We will try not to change the rules and
                    regulations unless there is a compelling need to do so. If we change the rules and regulations, we
                    will make every effort to notify you of the change through the <a href="blog.jsp">TwistedTrail Blog</a>.</p>
